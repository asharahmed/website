# Website

Local development copy of the static site served from `/var/www/html`.

Deployment happens via GitHub Actions and syncs to `/home/ubuntu/website` before running the deploy script. This note is here to trigger a workflow run.

## Deploy
Run:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

This syncs the repo contents to `/var/www/html`.

## Pipeline
Run CI checks and deploy in one step:

```bash
./scripts/pipeline.sh
```

To bypass git safety checks during deploy:

```bash
./scripts/deploy.sh --force
```

## Status Portal
A lightweight status portal lives at `/status` and is part of this web root.

Key endpoints:
- `/status` (UI)
- `/status/metrics.json` (system metrics snapshot)
- `/status/nginx` (Nginx stub_status)

Metrics are generated by `/usr/local/bin/status-metrics.sh` and refreshed by the `status-metrics.timer` systemd timer (every 10 seconds).
